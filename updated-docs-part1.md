# Mystery Hex Flower Investigations
## Part 1: Core System (Updated)

### 1. Introduction
Mystery Hex Flower Investigations is a system for running investigative scenarios using the Hex Flower Engine combined with The Cthulhu Hack's resource mechanics. This system guides investigations through a structured but flexible framework that maintains narrative momentum while creating interesting complications.

### 2. Core Components

#### The Hex Flower Map
A 19-hex structure divided into five zones:
- **Red Zone (Hexes 1-3)**: Case Resolution (Final confrontations or climactic reveals)
- **Blue Zone (Hexes 4-7)**: Evidence Gathering (Crime scenes, witness interviews, document analysis)
- **Green Zone (Hexes 8-10)**: Analysis (Breakthrough moments, connections, and deductions)
- **Yellow Zone (Hexes 11-14)**: Complications (False leads, obstacles, rival interference)
- **Purple Zone (Hexes 15-19)**: Leads & Starting Points (Initial clues, rumor gathering, and safe locations)

#### Resource Dice
Three core resources that degrade with use:
- **Investigation Die (d10)**: Research, deduction, and analysis.
- **Smokes Die (d8)**: Social interaction, contacts, and persuasion.
- **Flashlights Die (d6)**: Physical searches, evidence gathering, and hands-on investigations.

**Resource Mechanics Enhancements**:
- **Temporary Boosts**: Players can spend "Clue Tokens" to temporarily upgrade a die size for one roll.
- **Resource Recovery**: Points earned through breakthroughs or safe zones can restore dice.

#### Navigation System
Standard 2d6 roll consulting Navigation Hex:
- **Directional Flow**: Moves investigation based on rolls (favoring downward progress for success and upward movement for complications).
- **Edge Rules**:
  - **Wrap-around**: Moves continue to the opposite side of the hex grid for seamless transitions.
  - **Barriers**: Certain paths may be blocked, requiring resource checks to bypass.
  - **Nudge Mechanics**: Players can spend "Insight Points" to adjust rolls by 1-3 steps in any direction.

#### Investigation Clock
A pressure mechanic to create urgency:
- 6 segments total.
- **Triggers for Advancement**:
  - Entering the Yellow Zone.
  - Failing critical checks.
  - Major setbacks or resource exhaustion.
- **Multiple Clocks**:
  - **Time Clock**: Tracks investigation deadlines.
  - **Risk Clock**: Measures danger levels, escalating obstacles.
  - **Clue Clock**: Tracks evidence milestones, ensuring adequate preparation for the finale.

### 3. Basic Mechanics

#### Resource Usage
1. Choose appropriate resource for action.
2. Roll against difficulty (usually 4+).
3. **Success** provides information/progress.
4. **Failure** steps die down one size (minimum d4).
5. Exhausted resources trigger a clock advance.

#### Navigation
1. Start in **Purple Zone** (Leads).
2. Roll 2d6 for movement.
3. Apply **Navigation Hex** results (favoring progress or complications).
4. Use **Edge Rules** for transitions between zones.
5. Players may spend **Insight Points** to nudge rolls for strategic positioning.

#### Zone Effects
- **Purple Zone (15-19)**
  - Starting position.
  - New lead generation.
  - Flexible resource usage.
  - Free movement between adjacent hexes.
- **Blue Zone (4-7)**
  - Physical evidence collection.
  - Witness interviews.
  - Document research.
  - Resource must match evidence type.
- **Green Zone (8-10)**
  - Evidence analysis.
  - Pattern recognition.
  - Requires **Investigation Die**.
  - Connects separate clues.
- **Yellow Zone (11-14)**
  - Forces resource checks.
  - Creates complications and false leads.
  - Requires resources to escape or avoid setbacks.
- **Red Zone (1-3)**
  - Final revelations and confrontations.
  - Requires multiple successes.
  - Case breakthroughs and climactic resolutions.

### 4. Flow States

#### Progress Flow
- Default state.
- Movement tends downward.
- Favors evidence gathering and connections.
- Used when following leads.

#### Complication Flow
- Triggered by Yellow Zone.
- Movement tends upward.
- Creates investigation pressure.
- Requires resource use or clock trade-offs to escape.

### 5. Edge Rules

#### Basic Movement
- Wrap around edges to opposite sides where permitted.
- **Barriers** block movement unless overcome by checks.
- **Nudge Mechanics** allow players to adjust movement rolls by spending **Insight Points**.

#### Zone Transitions
- Must move through connecting zones.
- Cannot skip zone types without specific triggers.
- Resource checks or narrative triggers may alter paths.

### 6. Turn Mechanics

#### Basic Turn
- Spend any resource.
- Shift one hex face.
- Must make narrative sense.
- Cannot enter **Red Zone** directly.

#### Major Turn
- Spend **Investigation Die**.
- Shift two hex faces.
- Used for breakthroughs or major clues.
- Resource steps down as a cost.

#### Tactical Turn (New)
- Spend two matching resources.
- Choose any adjacent hex.
- Useful for strategic positioning.
- Cannot move into **Red Zone**.

#### Desperate Turn (New)
- Exhaust one resource.
- Move immediately to another zone.
- Advances the **Risk Clock**.

### 7. Scene Resolution

#### Process Steps
1. Determine scene location.
2. Choose appropriate resource.
3. Set difficulty level.
4. Make resource check.
5. Apply results.
6. Navigate hex flower.
7. Update clocks if needed.
8. Record evidence and connections.

#### Evidence Recording
- Note physical clues.
- Record witness statements.
- Document connections.
- Track resource use.
- Mark hex position.

### 8. Clock Management

#### Clock Advancement
- **Triggers**:
  - Yellow Zone entry (+1).
  - Failed critical checks (+1).
  - Major setbacks (+1).
  - Resource exhaustion (+1).

#### Clock Effects
- **Time Pressure** escalates as segments fill.
- **Risk Clock** influences danger levels.
- **Clue Clock** measures readiness for the final confrontation.

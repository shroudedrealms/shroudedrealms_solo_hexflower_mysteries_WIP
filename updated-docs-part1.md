# Mystery Hex Flower Investigations
## Part 1: Core System

### 1. Introduction
Mystery Hex Flower Investigations is a system for running investigative scenarios using the Hex Flower Engine combined with The Cthulhu Hack's resource mechanics. This system guides investigations through a structured but flexible framework that maintains narrative momentum while creating interesting complications.

### 2. Core Components

#### The Hex Flower Map
A 19-hex structure divided into five zones:
- Red Zone (Hexes 1-3): Case Resolution
- Blue Zone (Hexes 4-7): Evidence Gathering
- Green Zone (Hexes 8-10): Analysis
- Yellow Zone (Hexes 11-14): Complications
- Purple Zone (Hexes 15-19): Leads & Starting Points

#### Resource Dice
Three core resources that degrade with use:
- Investigation Die (d10): Research, deduction, analysis
- Smokes Die (d8): Social interaction, contacts
- Flashlights Die (d6): Physical searches, evidence gathering

#### Navigation System
Standard 2d6 roll consulting Navigation Hex:
- 12: Direct up/down
- 10-11: Upper left
- 2-3: Upper right
- 8-9: Lower left
- 4-5: Lower right
- 6-7: Direct down

#### Investigation Clock
- 6 segments total
- Fills as investigation faces setbacks
- Creates time pressure
- Influences case resolution

### 3. Basic Mechanics

#### Resource Usage
1. Choose appropriate resource for action
2. Roll against difficulty (usually 4+)
3. Success provides information/progress
4. Failure steps die down one size
5. Dies at d4 become exhausted

#### Navigation
1. Start in Purple Zone (Leads)
2. Roll 2d6 for movement
3. Check Navigation Hex
4. Apply zone effects
5. Move to new position

#### Zone Effects
**Purple Zone (15-19)**
- Starting position
- New lead generation
- Any resource usable
- Free movement between adjacent hexes

**Blue Zone (4-7)**
- Physical evidence collection
- Witness interviews
- Document research
- Resource matches evidence type

**Green Zone (8-10)**
- Evidence analysis
- Pattern recognition
- Requires Investigation die
- Connects separate clues

**Yellow Zone (11-14)**
- Forces resource checks
- Creates complications
- Can trigger flow change
- Needs resource to escape

**Red Zone (1-3)**
- Case breakthroughs
- Final revelations
- Multiple successes required
- Resolution zone

### 4. Flow States

#### Progress Flow
- Default state
- Movement tends downward
- Favors evidence gathering
- Used when following leads

#### Complication Flow
- Triggered by Yellow Zone
- Movement tends upward
- Creates investigation pressure
- Requires resource use to escape

### 5. Edge Rules

#### Basic Movement
- Wrap within same zone when moving off edge
- Cannot move directly between non-adjacent zones
- × blocks upward movement at Case Solved
- × blocks leaving Yellow zone without resource use

#### Zone Transitions
- Must move through connecting zones
- Cannot skip zone types
- Resources may be required
- Flow state affects direction

### 6. Turn Mechanics

#### Basic Turn
- Spend any resource
- Shift one hex face
- Must make narrative sense
- Cannot enter Red zone directly

#### Major Turn
- Spend Investigation die
- Shift two hex faces
- Used for breakthroughs
- Resource steps down

### 7. Scene Resolution

#### Basic Process
1. Determine scene location
2. Choose appropriate resource
3. Set difficulty level
4. Make resource check
5. Apply results
6. Navigate hex flower
7. Update clock if needed
8. Record evidence

#### Evidence Recording
- Note physical clues
- Record witness statements
- Document connections
- Track resource use
- Mark hex position

### 8. Clock Management

#### Clock Advancement
- Yellow Zone entry (+1)
- Failed critical checks (+1)
- Major setbacks (+1)
- Resource exhaustion (+1)

#### Clock Effects
- 2 segments: Time pressure mounts
- 4 segments: Resources strain
- 5 segments: Critical phase
- 6 segments: Forces conclusion

This concludes Part 1: Core System. Part 2 will cover advanced mechanics and Part 3 will provide GM guidance and tools.

- Final breakthroughs.

**Blue Zone (4-7)**
- Physical evidence gathering.
- Witness interviews.
- Document searches.

**Green Zone (8-10)**
- Evidence analysis.
- Pattern recognition.
- Connections and deductions.

**Yellow Zone (11-14)**
- Complications and obstacles.
- False leads and misdirection.

**Purple Zone (15-19)**
- New leads and starting points.
- Flexible resource use.

### 3. Advanced Navigation

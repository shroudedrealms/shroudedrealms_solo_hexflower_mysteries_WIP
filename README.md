## **How It Works**
1. **Hex Flower Map Navigation**
   - The investigation unfolds through movement across a **hexagonal grid**.  
   - Dice rolls determine movement, while zones represent different investigation phases (e.g., leads, evidence, analysis, complications, and resolutions).

2. **Resource Dice**
   - Players manage three core resources—**Investigation (d10)**, **Smokes (d8)**, and **Flashlights (d6)**—to resolve skill checks and explore the mystery.  
   - Dice degrade on failures, escalating tension and requiring resource recovery strategies.

3. **Clock Management**
   - **Time Clock:** Tracks deadlines to solve the case.  
   - **Risk Clock:** Escalates dangers and obstacles as time progresses.  
   - **Clue Clock:** Measures readiness for final confrontation based on gathered evidence.

4. **Narrative Zones**
   - Investigators move through **zones** with thematic effects:  
     - **Purple Zone (Leads):** Discover new clues and directions.  
     - **Blue Zone (Primary Evidence):** Gather physical evidence and testimonies.  
     - **Green Zone (Analysis):** Connect and analyze clues.  
     - **Yellow Zone (Complications):** Encounter obstacles and misdirection.  
     - **Red Zone (Revelations):** Solve the case or face consequences.

5. **Flexible Turns and Movement**
   - Players can nudge movement, spend resources, or take desperate actions to escape setbacks or advance breakthroughs.  
   - Insight Points enable strategic decision-making to influence outcomes.
